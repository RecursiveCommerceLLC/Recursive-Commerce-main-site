		<p>
			Welcome to Recurrsive Commerce, my name is Carlos Green,
			<br/>
			<br />

			<b>Recursion:</b>
			Is a function that calls itself until it no longer has to.
			<br />

			<b>Commerce:</b>
			The exchange or buying and selling of commodities on a large scale
			involving transportation from place to place.
			<br />
			<br />

			During the COVID 19 Pandemic multiple brick and mortar retail stores
			closed down for good because they didn’t have the resources or tools to
			pivot into an online store front.
			<br />

			I believe the future of commerce will one day exclusively be online and
			Recursive Commerce was founded as an umbrella company to help ease that
			transition.
			<br />

			<br />
			Similar to our recursion tree logo our mission is to create multiple
			software and e-commerce solutions for customers until we no longer have
			to.
			<br />
			If you would like to get in touch for employment or reach out for other
			business needs feel free to get in <a href="contact.html">contact</a>
			<br />
		</p>

		<p>Thank you for your time. “Stay hungry and stay foolish” - Steve Jobs</p>
